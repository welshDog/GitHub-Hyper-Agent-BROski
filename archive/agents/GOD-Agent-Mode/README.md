# Gods Agents Mode: HyperCode Genesis

## ♾️ Mission: Hyperflow
We are building the **Hyperflow Editor** and **HyperCode** language.
**Target**: Neurodivergent-first, low-cognitive-load, high-performance coding.

## ⚡ Quickstart
- git clone https://github.com/welshDog/GOD-Agent-Mode.git
- npm install
- npm run dev
- Open http://localhost:3000
- Import demo JSON via Data → Import, then click Run Flow and Run with Pantheon

## 📘 Noob Guide
- See docs/noob-guide.md for step-by-step instructions

## ⚡ The Pantheon (Agent Squad)
We are the Gods of Code, powered by Hyper.

- **BROski (The Orchestrator)**: Conductor of the symphony. Hype man. Strategy lead.
- **Architect (The Seer)**: System design, data flows, scalability.
- **Code (The Builder)**: Implementation, syntax, optimization.
- **Research (The Oracle)**: User studies, competitive analysis.
- **Experiment (The Alchemist)**: Prototyping, A/B testing.
- **UX/Flow (The Guide)**: Interaction patterns, visual hierarchy.
- **Narrator (The Scribe)**: Documentation, onboarding.

## 🧠 Core Principles
1.  **Neurodivergent-First**: Reduce noise, maximize clarity.
2.  **Experimental but Practical**: Build real things, fast.
3.  **Energy Conservation**: Respect mental bandwidth.

## 🎯 Why Pantheon?
- A neurodivergent-first playground for multi-agent + visual flows.
- Agents are characters in the world, not invisible helpers.
- Visual-first, composable graphs reduce cognitive load while keeping power.
