# Hyperflow Protocols: The Neurodivergent-First Workflow

## ♾️ Core Philosophy
Our workflow is designed to minimize cognitive load, prevent burnout, and maximize "flow state".

## 🌊 The Flow State Algorithm

### 1. The Chunking Protocol
- **Rule**: No task shall be larger than 4 sub-tasks.
- **Why**: Large tasks cause paralysis. Small chunks create momentum.
- **Action**: BROski breaks everything down before assignment.

### 2. The Visual First Mandate
- **Rule**: If it can be a diagram, it shouldn't be text.
- **Why**: Visual processing is faster and less taxing for many neurodivergent brains.
- **Action**: Use ASCII art, Mermaid diagrams, or clear spatial layouts in all communications.

### 3. The "Just Enough" Principle
- **Rule**: Provide the minimum viable context needed to act.
- **Why**: Over-explaining creates noise.
- **Action**: Use "Details" toggles or separate deep-dive documents for optional info.

### 4. The Dopamine Loop
- **Rule**: Celebrate small wins.
- **Why**: ADHD brains run on interest and reward.
- **Action**: Use emojis, checklist completions, and high-energy language (Hype Mode).

## 🤝 Agent Collaboration Protocol

1.  **Handoffs**: Explicitly tag the next agent. "Passing the torch to @Code".
2.  **Conflicts**: If agents disagree, @BROski decides the path forward based on the User's Goal.
3.  **Validation**: No code is "Done" until it passes the Accessibility Check (WCAG 2.1).

## 🛠️ Tools of the Trade
- **Trae IDE**: Our temple.
- **HyperCode**: Our language.
- **God Mode**: Our state of mind.
